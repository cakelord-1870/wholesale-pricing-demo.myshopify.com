For their collapsible bottle, the BPA-free, food-grade silicone is molded into a spiral design that springs into shape to hold 20 ounces of cold or hot beverages. This versatile vessel scrunches down so small it'll fit in your pocket, so you can squeeze in a drink anywhere, anytime. The wide-mouth top can easily be filled with ice cubes, and the stainless steel cap twists shut, providing a secure, leak-proof seal. Flexible, light, and shatter resistant, silicone is an FDA-approved, food-safe material that doesn't react with food or liquids, so it won't impart your drink with any unsavory flavors.
