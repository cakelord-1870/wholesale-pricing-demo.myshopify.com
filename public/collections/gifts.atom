<p><span>For many people, creative writing sounds fun but intimidating. "I'm not good at that," they think, without even knowing where they’d start. Experienced writers, on the other hand, may know exactly where to start, but have plenty of other excuses for not putting pen to paper: too busy, too tired, or the dreaded "writer's block". <br><br>The solution for both is the same: just start writing. This handy workbook will give you plenty of fun, low-pressure opportunities for you to get your imagination flowing. Collected from the minds and notebooks of the San Francisco Writers' Grotto, the book's prompts range from personal reflection, to silly lyric writing, to character development, and everything in between and beyond. Take them seriously or just have fun. Grab a pen, open this book to any page, and find the writer inside you. Printed in China.</span></p>

<p><span>Jean and Kevin Wu found it unnerving that many public places accumulate so much plastic waste every day and decided to create a water bottle that's pliable, portable, and matches your personal lifestyle. For their collapsible bottle, the BPA-free, food-grade silicone is molded into a spiral design that springs into shape to hold 20 ounces of cold or hot beverages. This versatile vessel scrunches down so small it'll fit in your pocket, so you can squeeze in a drink anywhere, anytime. The wide-mouth top can easily be filled with ice cubes, and the stainless steel cap twists shut, providing a secure, leak-proof seal. Flexible, light, and shatter resistant, silicone is an FDA-approved, food-safe material that doesn't react with food or liquids, so it won't impart your drink with any unsavory flavors. Made in China.</span></p>

<p><span>Kids sometimes see the arrival of a new baby in the family as a cause for jealousy, but this charming, customized hardcover book can help those new big sisters see how they fit in the picture. Written by Laura Numeroff, author of <i>If Your Give a Mouse a Cookie</i>, the book explains all the things a big sister can do for their little siblings. Big sis will be delighted to see her name appear on the cover and throughout the story, along with a special dedication message from you on the front page. <br><br>The book is written as if regaling the new sibling with all the loving things the older child will do. This helps to model positive sibling interaction without feeling preachy, and also provides an opportunity for big sisters to share the book once the little one is old enough to enjoy story time. <br><br>The pages are warmly illustrated by Lynn Munsinger, with cute tigers, bears, pigs having adventures with their little brothers or sisters. Printed in the USA. </span></p>
