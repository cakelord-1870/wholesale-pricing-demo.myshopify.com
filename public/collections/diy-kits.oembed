From the hardy terrarium plant seeds to the proprietary soil mix, each aspect of this DIY conservatory was coordinated through the conjunction of art, science and design to help the timid terrarium-maker or bad news botanist. The handsome glass and wood vessel includes detailed instructions, packets of all the necessary terrarium layers, and embellishments such as black lichen, reindeer moss, lichen branch, and a couple of cute bunnies for extra luck. You'll be the architect of your own verdant tabletop realm in no time! Handmade in Brooklyn.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is a demo store.
