<p><span>For many people, creative writing sounds fun but intimidating. "I'm not good at that," they think, without even knowing where they’d start. Experienced writers, on the other hand, may know exactly where to start, but have plenty of other excuses for not putting pen to paper: too busy, too tired, or the dreaded "writer's block". <br><br>The solution for both is the same: just start writing. This handy workbook will give you plenty of fun, low-pressure opportunities for you to get your imagination flowing. Collected from the minds and notebooks of the San Francisco Writers' Grotto, the book's prompts range from personal reflection, to silly lyric writing, to character development, and everything in between and beyond. Take them seriously or just have fun. Grab a pen, open this book to any page, and find the writer inside you. Printed in China.</span></p>

<p>You don't need a still or a garden of obscure botanicals to make your own fragrant absinthe with this DIY kit. Just add your favorite high proof neutral<em>—</em>the kit has everything else to transform the liquor into the storied "Green Fairy" beloved of 19th century artists and writers (without the notorious neurotoxins of Bohemian legend). The key to the kit is a blend of eleven certified organic botanicals from around the world<em>—</em>including Fennel, Anise, Licorice, Hyssop, Angelica, and Artemisia<em>—</em>which add heady complexity to the brew. The kit also includes a 500 ml Tortuga antique green bottle with custom-designed label, a 4 inch funnel, a natural coffee filter, and easy instructions for brewing your absinthe. The label invites customization to record your cocktail creation. Assembled in Nevada by cocktail-loving couple Ryan and Melanie Belshee. Refill kits also available to keep the Green Fairy flowing.</p>

<p><span>The judge presents a yellow card, your fellow kitchen-table thespians respond, and before you know it, you've got "If music be the food of <i>ill-shaped fishes,</i> play on". A laugh-till-you-cry look at the Bard's smutty side, the raunchy hilarity of this game knows no bounds. Invented by an English professor and his students, this adult card game asks the low-brow literary question, "To be profane, or not to be?" It includes 100 mock-serious questions for our time and 375 responses drawn word-for-word from the works of William Shakespeare. For four or more over-educated adult players only. Designed by Tim Cassedy, Chelsea Grogan, Jenna Peck, and Kate Petsche. Made in Texas.</span></p>

<p>What's Homer Simpson's favorite beer? What does the term<span> </span><i>lager</i><span> </span>mean? And why is the glass tilted when serving beer? From Pilsner to Stout, from hop yard to Hefeweizen, this game will help you discover the tempting trivia behind the wonderful world of beer. It features 400 multiple-choice questions covering beer history and lore, with answers adding or subtracting IQ points from your score. A two-round format favors learning—the first tests your knowledge, while the second tests your memory, giving novices a chance to challenge seasoned hop heads. It's a great gift for beer and trivia lovers, whatever their favorite brew. Made in Poland.</p>
