A laugh-till-you-cry look at the Bard's smutty side, the raunchy hilarity of this game knows no bounds. Invented by an English professor and his students, this adult card game asks the low-brow literary question, \"To be profane, or not to be?\" It includes 100 mock-serious questions for our time and 375 responses drawn word-for-word from the works of William Shakespeare. For four or more over-educated adult players only. Designed by Tim Cassedy, Chelsea Grogan, Jenna Peck, and Kate Petsche.
