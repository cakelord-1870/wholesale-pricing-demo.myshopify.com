<p>You don't need a still or a garden of obscure botanicals to make your own fragrant absinthe with this DIY kit. Just add your favorite high proof neutral<em>—</em>the kit has everything else to transform the liquor into the storied "Green Fairy" beloved of 19th century artists and writers (without the notorious neurotoxins of Bohemian legend). The key to the kit is a blend of eleven certified organic botanicals from around the world<em>—</em>including Fennel, Anise, Licorice, Hyssop, Angelica, and Artemisia<em>—</em>which add heady complexity to the brew. The kit also includes a 500 ml Tortuga antique green bottle with custom-designed label, a 4 inch funnel, a natural coffee filter, and easy instructions for brewing your absinthe. The label invites customization to record your cocktail creation. Assembled in Nevada by cocktail-loving couple Ryan and Melanie Belshee. Refill kits also available to keep the Green Fairy flowing.</p>

Representing the true terroir of Napa Valley and the deep, full-bodied character of this noble California red grape, this wine has the typically intense Cab flavor and aroma.<br><br>The only challenge will be learning your winespeak, so repeat after us: "My 2017 Chateau Moi Cabernet is flamboyant yet austere, with a laser-like insouciance, a bouquet as muscular as a Malibu surfer, and a finish as long as the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge."

<p><span>Upon listening to her college roommate recount her family's process of tamale-making that has been passed down through the generations, foodie designer Carley Sheehy created a DIY recipe kit that allows even the novice to roll up their sleeves and throw their own <i>tamalada</i>. In Mexico and many South American countries, tamales represent a holiday tradition that combines family and food into an all-day cooking marathon that ends in unwrapping some delicious "presents." Master the time-honored techniques with Carley's step-by-step instructions: make the masa, add your favorite fillings, wrap in corn husks, and steam. Once cooked, open and drape them in a piquant, three-pepper sauce of ancho, pasilla, and New Mexico chilies, and savor a taste of a rich culinary tradition. Starter kit makes about 16 tamales. Assembled in Livermore, California.</span></p>

<p><span>In the land of leafy greens, kale reigns supreme (we hear its marketing team is top notch). Enjoy it in your own farm-to-table salads with this easy DIY kit. Get the seeds started right in the natural jute bag, and once they're ready to grow on their own, transfer the whole biodegradable bag out to the garden. The seeds are "dinosaur kale," a cold, hardy variety that thrives when planted in cool weather and will continue producing all the way up until the ground freezes. Its vitamin-rich leaves are great in salads, stir-fries, and casseroles. Jute bag from India; kit assembled in New Jersey.</span></p>

A golden, honey-based liquor, mead is the ancestor of all fermented beverages, originating in Asia over 9,000 years ago. It also flows through the history of the ancient world and medieval Europe, and inspires the familiar term "honeymoon" (the first month of marriage, when couples would toast with mead). This kit makes you part of this rich and exclusive history with everything you'll need to make a half gallon of your own mead to celebrate your honeymoon or share with friends and family.</span></p>

<p><span>Just as it takes hot water to bring tea leaves to life, this self-hydrating system by Sarah Burrows and Nick Behr starts the process from the ground up. The idea for this system grew from the makers' struggle to sustain a kitchen garden in their fourth-floor Chicago apartment. The busy professionals turned to hydroponics for help and were astounded by the results. Designed for space-conscious urbanites, home cooks, and aspiring indoor farmers, each of their kits is outfitted with reusable glass canning jars. The jars are threaded with wicks that pull water into the transplantable coco husk pots, keeping your teas-to-be hydrated. Once your organic mint, bee balm, and lemon basil seeds have sprouted, transfer the seedlings along with their biodegradable pots outside to thrive in your garden. Snip the herbs and mix with your favorite teas for a delightful boost of fresh flavor. Assembled in Illinois.</span></p>

<p><span>Just as it takes hot water to bring tea leaves to life, this self-hydrating system by Sarah Burrows and Nick Behr starts the process from the ground up. The idea for this system grew from the makers' struggle to sustain a kitchen garden in their fourth-floor Chicago apartment. The busy professionals turned to hydroponics for help and were astounded by the results. Designed for space-conscious urbanites, home cooks, and aspiring indoor farmers, each of their kits is outfitted with reusable glass canning jars. The jars are threaded with wicks that pull water into the transplantable coco husk pots, keeping your teas-to-be hydrated. Once your organic mint, bee balm, and lemon basil seeds have sprouted, transfer the seedlings along with their biodegradable pots outside to thrive in your garden. Snip the herbs and mix with your favorite teas for a delightful boost of fresh flavor. Assembled in Illinois.</span></p>

<p><span>Grow your own soaring sunflowers with this easy DIY kit. Start the included seeds in the natural jute bag, and then transfer the seeding—biodegradable bag and all—to the garden. No uprooting baby sunflowers required, as the plant-based jute will disintegrate in the soil, giving the roots room to grow and allowing the plants to fully mature into sunny, happiness-inspiring blooms. Instructions included. Jute bag from India; kit assembled in the New Jersey.</span></p>

<p><span>Why go out for sushi when you can serve your own, handcrafted sushi rolls right in the comfort of your own kitchen? Carley Sheehy wondered the same thing, and created this DIY kit which includes everything you'll need to create these Japanese delights that are as fun to make as they are to eat. Get started with the popular sushi roll recipes included, or add a medley of your own ingredients to construct a custom-made roll that's jam-packed with your favorite flavors. In addition to a rolling mat, easy-to-follow instructions, and helpful drink pairings, the kit also comes with the base ingredients for four servings of sushi, including sushi rice, rice vinegar, nori—the special seaweed used to bind rolls—sesame seeds, spicy wasabi powder, gluten-free soy sauce—just add your favorite fillings! Made in Livermore, California.</span></p>
