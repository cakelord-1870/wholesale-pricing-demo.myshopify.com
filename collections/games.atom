<p><span>The judge presents a yellow card, your fellow kitchen-table thespians respond, and before you know it, you've got "If music be the food of <i>ill-shaped fishes,</i> play on". A laugh-till-you-cry look at the Bard's smutty side, the raunchy hilarity of this game knows no bounds. Invented by an English professor and his students, this adult card game asks the low-brow literary question, "To be profane, or not to be?" It includes 100 mock-serious questions for our time and 375 responses drawn word-for-word from the works of William Shakespeare. For four or more over-educated adult players only. Designed by Tim Cassedy, Chelsea Grogan, Jenna Peck, and Kate Petsche. Made in Texas.</span></p>

<p><span>Dice have been around for thousands of years, but artist William Manke still found a way to rethink the familiar numbered squares. His clever design shows the face value of each side with 1 to 6 wood segments of different color tones, made of walnut, maple, and cherry wood. Handsome enough to display when they're not involved in games of Backgammon, Bunco, Farkle, Yahtzee, Craps, or Pig, these beautifully crafted pieces make wonderful gifts for game lovers, woodworking fans, and anyone with an appreciation for exquisite small objects. Handmade in Lakewood, Colorado.</span></p>
