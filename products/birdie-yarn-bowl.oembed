With a hand-sculpted sparrow perched along its edge, Aaron A. Harrison's stoneware bowl keeps skeins of yarn in place while you knit, crochet, or weave. A hooked opening allows the yarn to unfurl in a steady stream, and holes pierced in the bowl's side offer a convenient resting spot for needles between knits and purls. A little bird told us that this is the perfect crafting companion for when you're creating your own homespun creations for all your close-knits. Handmade in upstate New York.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is a demo store.
